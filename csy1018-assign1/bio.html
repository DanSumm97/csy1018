             <h1> Hi there!...</h1>
             <p>So about me. I am a 19 year Old Male, born and bred in the
               small but noisey town of Northampton, England. In this town is
               also where i have grown up with a passion of all things technical
               and electronic, the household suffered a great deal of gadgets and
               gizmos being disasembled and spread across the floor of my bedroom. </p>

                <p>fro mthis is where it started, the passion to see how things worked
                  lead to years of study in everything computer related. another passion
                  growing up was the world of the video games industry, a world that creates
                  universes and realms for you to explore, the imense fun i gained from playing
                  with friends and seeing how this industry brings people together, all over
                  the planet lead me to want to learn to make games myself to bring the same
                  pleasure i had as a kid to others. as of now i am studying at University
                  to follow that dream.</p>
