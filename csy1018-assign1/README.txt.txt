Day 1 of Website design - 5/12/16 -

I started this project by making a few mock designs of how i would like the Website to be layed out.
I knew how i wanted to asthetics to be but just were'nt sure of how i wanted the layout to be.
i made a few wire frames to visualize what was best for my site.

The wireframes are in a folder named 'wireframes'. They are listed in how the navigation bar would navigate you through the site, flowing simplistically.

- Home - The home page - this conssits of the Navigation bar that will be dorment throughout the website at the top of the page, it also includes a short
description/ welcome message and my Logo, it may also include a footer which will also be seen throughout the site.

- About - About Me - its very similar to the homepage except this will be a page with a bit more of a desciption that will be focused on me. still keeping the navigation bar and the footer.

- CV - the CV page will again be very similar to the rest except this time it will display the main qaulifications and achievements and will have a download link to my full CV
(it wont be a real CV(purely for functionality at this point).

- Contact me - this page again keeping the them will include a small description and a selection of links to all of the sites, social media and Emails available for someone to
contact me. still keeping the Navigation bar and footer throughout.

aproximately 2 hours on design




- Day 2 of web design - 14/12/16 -

starting thew build of the index.html(home page)
i have used a background image supplied by 'pixabay.com', they are a free source of images for commercial use, my background is a rustic walpaper looking background
https://pixabay.com/en/brown-close-up-hd-wallpaper-surface-1866661/

the build is going well and looks very pleasing. no problems as of yet.

i have decided to abolish the footer from the design completely, i have also added to the homepage a portfolio icon, a kind of "my latest work".

the home page is completed and looks brilliant.

ran into a few problems in terms of referencing, the html file couldn't find the css file, was solved by adding "../" to the front of the link, so it looks like this "../css/stylesheet.css"

aproximately 6hours in total on the index.html and its partnered css stylesheet.




- Day 3 of web design - 18/12/16 -

Moving on to the about page, keeping the same asthetic my logo and the background

testing the implemented nav bar and it succesfully switches between the pages, the navbar also has a colour change on the buttons to signify which page you are currently on.

the bio in the about me page consists of two paragraphs, consideration for a photo of myself was possible however haven't included one yet.

css for this page is also complete.

moved on to the CV page, i have completed the structure will finish the page when i return to the project next.

the CSS file for some reason now links fine without the need of the "../" at the front and doesn't work if it is there now. it may have been a bug of some sort.

there are no further problems and everything went relatively smoothly.

Aproximately 6 hours including the about.html, css styling and the small amount of cv.html.



- Day 4 of web design - 28/12/16 -

Focusing on the CV part of the website. keeping the same asthetics.

ran into an issue where a list in the CV section was conflicting with a last child specification in the CSS. this was because the navbar works 
on a list as well. i fixed this by giving the list in the CV a class of its own.

created a download image for the CV download link.

download link works perfectly.

css styling is done too.

approximately 2 hours in total.

Just noticed my git commit hasn't been working need to fix.



- Day 5 of web design - 1/1/17 - 
final contact page to do. keeping the same asthetics.

small description. also created a bunch of icons for each website/ social media/ email in photoshop, given them a drawn looking asthetic.
they are exported as standard PNG's.

the icons have been ordered in such a way that they are responsive with the page. this is a fucntionality i want to implement in all pages, going to go and make sure its throughout each page.

all of the links in the images work and take you to genuine pages, including email.

all pages are completed, need to go over all pages to make sure that they all have the functionality i wanted in them.

approximately 2 hours in total.

git commit still not working. cant find a solution as of yet.



- Day 6 of web design - 3/1/17 -
testing and overveiw of the entire site, making sure the functionality is all there.
